# Quora-for-Engineering-students
QES is a question and answer website for Engineering students. We tend to create a flagship site similar to the Stack Overflow Site of the Stack Exchange Network, created in 2008 by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky. QES features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in Engineering. Our notion of a better-connected engineering community to tackle all kinds of academic and non Academical quesuns an rems woud the community better. Establishing a community-based platform like this would help bypass the location barrier for Engineering students.
